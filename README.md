üß† Sports Genius Admin + User Dashboard Build Plan
(Gameplan for Tokenized AI Models, Page Builder, Prediction Contests, and Ad Campaigns)
üî© CORE SYSTEMS & STRUCTURE
Tokenization System

Tracks token usage per user; each AI model or contest consumes tokens.

Users see token balance + what they‚Äôve spent tokens on in their profile.

AI Model Builder

Build models by sport and betting type (e.g. NFL > DFS Lineup).

Includes model name, description, LLM provider, template instructions, optional API feed, and token cost.

Analyzer Builder

Connects to AI Model.

Lets user run a model and returns results in styled card format.

Optionally integrates sportsbook API data.

Dynamic Analyzer Execution

Analyzer determines which AI model to run based on config (e.g. NFL DFS vs Player Props).

Prediction Contests

Run thumbs up/down contests from analyzer results.

Each contest costs X tokens to enter.

Each entry is tracked for results (win/loss) and leaderboard scoring.

Leaderboard System

Track per-contest entries, results, and prizes.

Multiple leaderboard types supported (e.g. DFS, Prop, Parlay).

Includes "See My Picks" section for users.

üß± PAGE BUILDER IN ADMIN
